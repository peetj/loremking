# Lorem King README

LoremKing is a Visual Studio Code extension that replaces the traditional "Lorem ipsum" placeholder text with something more engagingâ€”famous quotes from Stephen King novels. Whether you're a developer working on HTML, JavaScript, or any other type of file, this extension adds a bit of intrigue to your mock text with a simple trigger.

Alternatively, you can insert text inline simply by typing into the editor the keyword: `deadzone` which pays homage to one of my favourite King books: "The Dead Zone"
